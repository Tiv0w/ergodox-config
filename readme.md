# My Ergodox config

[The cheatsheet](https://github.com/Tiv0w/ergodox-config/blob/master/keymap-cheatsheet.pdf)

### Generated Keymap Layout

This layout was first generated by the QMK API. You can find the JSON data used to
generate this keymap in the file `ergodox_ez-tiv0w.json`.

To make use of this file you will need follow the following steps:

* Download or Clone QMK Firmware: <https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/>
* Extract QMK Firmware to a location on your hard drive
* Copy this folder into %s
* You are now ready to compile or use your keymap with the source

---

I compiled mine using the following commands:

```sh
./bin/qmk compile -kb ergodox_ez -km tiv0w
```

and then flashed it using the [ZSA Wally](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/wally).

More information can be found in the QMK docs: <https://docs.qmk.fm>
